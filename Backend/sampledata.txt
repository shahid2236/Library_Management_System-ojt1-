#20 Library Management System Sample Data & Testing 
In testing the Library Management System, a comprehensive dataset has been meticulously curated to simulate real-world scenarios and ensure robust functionality. The provided sample data encompasses various facets of library operations, including book details such as title, author, and availability, as well as user information and transaction records. By incorporating diverse genres and users profiles, this dataset facilitates thorough testing of system features such as book borrowing, return processes, and inventory management. Through rigorous testing with this representative dataset, developers can validate system behaviour, identify potential edge cases, and ensure the system's reliability and scalability under different usage scenarios, ultimately contributing to the delivery of a high-quality library management solution.
